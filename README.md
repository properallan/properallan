- 👋 Hi, Hi, I’m Allan Moreira de Carvalho (@properallan)
- 👀 I’m interested in computational fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, turbomachinery, aerospace engineering and more recently machine learning, artificial inteligence, neural networks, model order reduction and surrogate models.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all of the stuff that I'm intereseted in (Phd. on Energy at Federal University of ABC).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source softwares for computational fluid dynamics, specialy that ones aimed to turbomachinery simulations and the utilization of surrogate models to order reduction and inverse design.

- 👋 Hi, I’m Allan Moreira de Carvalho (@properallan)
- 👀 I’m interested in computational fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, turbomachinery, aerospace engineering and more recently machine learning, artificial inteligence, neural networks, model order reduction and surrogate models.
- 🌱 I’m currently attending the Phd. course on Energy at Federal University of ABC.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software development for computational fluid dynamics, specially for turbomachinery flows and the use of machine-learning thecninques to model order reduction and inverse design.
